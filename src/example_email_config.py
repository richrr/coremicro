# This is an example of what email_config.py should look like.
# email_config.py contains api keys, and so is not kept in version control.

# Address to send emails from
FROM_EMAIL = 'donotreply@example.com'  # Replace with actual address

# Mailjet api key and secret key
API_KEY = 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'  # Replace with actual key
SECRET_KEY = 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'  # Replace with actual key
